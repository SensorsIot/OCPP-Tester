VERSION DATE DESCRIPTION
2025-04 2025-04-30 Errata sheet release 2025-04.
v1.0 Release 2019-12-04 Release of the OCPP-J errata sheet
1
1. Scope
This document contains errata on the OCPP 1.6-J specification (JSON) and JSON-Schema files.
1.1. JSON Schema files
With the release of this version of the erratasheet (2025-04) also a OCPP 1.6 JSON Schema file was updated.
Version information has been added to all the files: ID field. The updated StopTransaction.req JSON Schema file
for this version is marked with: "urn:OCPP:1.6:2025:04"
1.2. Terminology and Conventions
Underlined: when needed to clarify differences, they might be underlined.
2. Major errata
Problems with the content/definition of the messages, class and enumerations of the protocol.
2.1. (2025-04) - MeterValues.json and StopTransaction.json incorrect spelling of
Celsius V2
Note: This erratum supersedes erratum: MeterValues.json and StopTransaction.json incorrect spelling of Celsius
There are several issues with the original erratum that needs to be revised.
The erratum advises Central System implementers to update their own JSON schemas to also allow the correct
spelling. This brings risks, as the erratum is easily missed and the JSON schema’s will be used as available on the
website.
In addition, the erratum advises the Charge Point implementers to update their messages to use the corrected
spelling. This poses significant risk as this will cause interoperability issues with all Central Systems that have not
updated their JSON schemas.
Finally, while the erratum mentions that the JSON schemas will not be fixed, the MeterValues.req JSON schema
was updated. Unfortunately the StopTransaction.req JSON schema was missed. Updating the JSON schemas so
they contain both spellings is the correct decision, because the main purpose of the JSON schemas is that they
are being used for JSON Schema validation. In this case we always want to allow both spellings, to maximize
interoperability. The secondary purpose is generating the message data model from them, but even in that case
the Charge Point implementer makes an active decision on which unit of measure to send. Both spellings would
be a valid choice, but when a Charge Point implementer reads this erratum, it recommends to use the not
corrected version of the spelling; Celcius, to maximize interoperability.
Summary:
1. The JSON schema StopTransaction.req is updated to also include the corrected spelling Celsius.
2. Charge Point implementers are advised to remain using the not corrected version of the spelling
Celcius.
2
3. Central System implementers are advised to use the updated JSON schema for their JSON schema
validation and accept both spellings; Celsius and Celcius.
2.2. MeterValues.json and StopTransaction.json incorrect spelling of Celsius
Note: This erratum has been superseded by erratum: (2025-04) - MeterValues.json and StopTransaction.json incorrect
spelling of Celsius V2
The OCPP 1.6 JSON schema message definitions set, as originally published, contains a typo that renders it
inconsistent with both the written OCPP 1.6 specification and the SOAP/XML Schema/WSDLs schema definitions.
In the MeterValues and StopTransaction message structure (in MeterValues.json and StopTransaction.json), the
definition of Celsius as a unit has been misspelled as: "Celcius".
We advise implementers of an OCPP 1.6 JSON Central System to add the correct spelling (Celsius) to the
enumeration. This way your implementation will support both the correct and the incorrect spellings. Somebody
implementing a OCPP 1.6 JSON Charge Point, and using the object generated by the WSDL files to serialize JSON
might send the correct spelling to a Central System.
We advise the implementers of OCPP 1.6 JSON Charge Points to correct the spelling mistake.
 This issue will not be fixed in future schema files, Central Systems need to support both, and
adding both in the Schema could be confusing for Charge Point implementers.
2.3. SendLocalList.json schema file incorrect
The OCPP 1.6 JSON schema file for SendLocalList is incorrect, as it is not a valid JSON Schema draft-04.
The part that defines the "idTagInfo" is incorrect: "expiryDate" and "parentIdTag" should have been part of the
properties.
Incorrect
"idTagInfo": {
"type": "object",
"expiryDate": {
"type": "string",
"format": "date-time"

"required": [
"status"
]
}
Corrected
"idTagInfo": {

}
},
"required": [
"status"
]
}
A newer JSON Schema will be provided. When using JSON Schemas, this newer schema SHALL be used, the older
version cannot be parsed by (most) JSON schema tools.
2.4. BootNotificationResponse.json schema file incorrect
The OCPP 1.6 JSON schema file for BootNotificationResponse contains an error. The field "interval" is defined as
a 'number', but should have been: 'integer'
The WSDL files for OCPP-S is correct.
Incorrect

2.5. UpdateFirmware.json schema file incorrect
The OCPP 1.6 JSON schema file for UpdateFirmware contains 2 errors. The fields "retries" and "retryInterval" are
defined as a 'number', but should have been: 'integer'
The WSDL files for OCPP-S is correct.
Incorrect
{
"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
"title": "UpdateFirmwareRequest",
"type": "object",
"properties": {

"type": "string",

"additionalProperties": false,
"required": [
"location",
"retrieveDate"
]
}
2.6. StopTransaction.json "reason" incorrectly required
The OCPP 1.6 JSON schema message definitions set, as originally published, contain an error that renders it
inconsistent with both the written OCPP 1.6 specification and the SOAP/XML Schema/WSDLs schema definitions.
In the StopTransactionRequest message structure (StopTransaction.json), the “reason” element is incorrectly
marked as being “required”, whereas the human-readable protocol specification document and the SOAP WSDL
service definition file both explicitly define it to be “optional”, with an explicitly defined implied default value
(“Local”), as stated in Sections 4.10 (p46) and 6.49 (p82) of the OCPP 1.6 Specification.
We advise implementers of an OCPP 1.6 JSON to remove the "reason" field from the list of required fields at the
bottom of the file, or download the correct set of JSON schema from the OCA website.
To the best understanding of the TWG, the only case where any existing OCPP 1.6 implementation would be
impacted by this correction is when a Central System implementation currently enforces the “required” status of
“reason” in received JSON StopTransaction requests, and is controlling a network containing Charge Points that
are using OCPP 1.6 JSON, but omitting the StopTransaction “reason”, as is allowed by the specification.
3. Minor errata
Improvements to the descriptions on how the protocol (should) work.
3.1. Page 11 - (2025-04) - Section 4.1.4. Message ID - Improved text for unique message
ID
Old text The message ID serves to identify a request. A message ID for a CALL message MUST be different from all message IDs
previously used by the same sender for CALL messages on the same WebSocket connection. A message ID for a CALLRESULT
or CALLERROR message MUST be equal to that of the CALL message that the CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message is a
response to.
New text The message ID serves to identify a request. A message ID for a CALL message MUST be different from all message IDs
previously used by the same sender for CALL messages on any WebSocket connection u s ing the same unique Charging Station
i d e n t i f i e r . T he message ID for a retried message (e.g. when no response was received within timeout) MAY be identical to the
m essage ID of the original message. A message ID for a CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message MUST be equal to that of the
CALL message that the CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message is a response to.
7
3.2. JSON Schema files do allow for extra fields within inner objects.
It is not allowed to add extra fields/values to OCPP messages, this could cause interoperability issues in the field.
The WSDL files are correct, the original JSON Schema files allow extra fields on inner objects and extra values on
enums, which was not intended.
Most of the JSON Schema files have been updated to fix this. The line: "additionalProperties": false has
been added to the definition of all object and enum definitions.
3.3. No definition of: 'failure to process the message'
The OCPP 1.6 spec points to the OCPP-J spec for a definition on how a JSON implementation should respond to a
request to indicate: 'failure to process message', but there was no definition of: 'failure to process the message'
in the OCPP-J spec.
To following text should be added to: Page 9, par 3.2:
"For a definition on how a server SHALL report a 'failure to process the message', see: CallError"
To following text should be added to: Page 13, par 4.2.3:
"When a server needs to report a 'failure to process the message', the server SHALL use a Message Type:
CallError (MessageTypeNumber = 4)."
3.4. Page 8, section: 3.2: Missing Charge Point should retry after having received
HTTP 404.
When a Charge Point tries to connect the a Central System, the Central System, when it does not know the
Charge Point might reject the connection by responding with HTTP 404 as defined in Section 3.2.
The Charge Point is then expected to retry the connection every X times, same as with the BootNotification, but
this is not specified.
Addition text for the first bullet in Section 3.2
Additional text The Charge Point SHALL retry with an appropriate back-off mechanism to prevent overloading the Central System.
3.5. Page 10, section: 4.1.1: Synchronicity explanation can be improved
Not clear to all implementers that the Central System does not have to wait for a response from Charging
Station 1 when sending something to Charging Station 2.
The following is to be added at the end of the first paragraph
Additional text This does not mean that the Central System cannot send a message to another Charge Point, while waiting for a response of a
first Charge Point, this rule is per OCPP-J connection.
8
3.6. Page 10, par 4.1.3: 'Client-to-Server' and 'Server-to-Client' is confusing.
The table on page 9 contains a definition of the 3 different types of messages in the OCPP RPC framework. But
the direction is confusing. With WebSockets, on the WebSocket level, the Central System is always the Server.
Old text New text
Direction Description
Client-to-Server Request message
Server-to-Client (CALLRESULT) Response message
Server-to-Client (CALLERROR) Error response to a request message
3.7. Page 11, Section 4.1.4. The message ID must be unique [DRAFT]
Below text uses the wording 'on the same WebSocket connection', however this can be interpreted in multiple
ways. It was intended to mean that that the messageId must be different from all messageIds previously used by
the same sender for any other CALL message on any WebSocket connection with the same 'connection URL' as
defined by section 3.1.1. The connection URL. The current wording seems to indicate that it may use the same
messageId after every reconnect, however this may cause major issues. Especially when looking at the OCPP
message queuing mechanisms.
Old text:
The message ID serves to identify a request. A message ID for any CALL message MUST be different from
all message IDs previously used by the same sender for any other CALL messages on the same WebSocket
connection. A message ID for a CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message MUST be equal to that of the CALL
message that the CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message is a response to.
Table 1. Unique Message ID
NAME DATATYPE RESTRICTIONS
messageId string Unique message ID, maximum length of 36 characters, to allow for UUIDs/GUIDs
New text:
The message ID serves to identify a request. A message ID for any CALL message MUST be different from
all message IDs previously used by the same sender for any other CALL message on any WebSocket
connection with the same 'connection URL' as defined by section 3.1.1. The connection URL. A
message ID for a CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message MUST be equal to that of the CALL message that the
CALLRESULT or CALLERROR message is a response to.

Table 2. Unique Message ID
NAME DATATYPE RESTRICTIONS
messageId string Unique message ID, maximum length of 36 characters, to allow for UUIDs/GUIDs
3.8. Page 11, par 4.2: No reference to the JSON Schemas
The OCPP-J Spec has no reference to the JSON Schemas and schema version.
Additional reference in 1.6 references on page 3:
[JSON_SCHEMA] http://json-schema.org/
Additional text:
4.2.4 Schemas Together with this document, there are also JSON Schema files provided. These schemas can be
used for validation of OCPP-J messages.
The OCPP-J 1.6 Schema files are [JSON_SCHEMA] draft-04 schemas.
3.9. Page 14, section: 4.2.3: No example of CallError
There is no example of a CallError in the document, the following is an example.
[4,
"162376037",
"NotSupported",
"SendLocalList.req not implemented",
{}
]
3.10. Page 15, section: 5: Explanation how to respond to message before Charge Point
is accepted.
There is no explanation for how a Central System should respond to any CALL message from the Charge Point
(other then BootNotification.req) before being accepted by the Central System.
Additional section 5.6 Charge Point CALL message before accepted
When a Central System receives CALL messages (other then BootNotification) from a Charge Point before the Charge Point is
accepted, the Central System is RECOMMENDED to respond with and RPC CallError: SecurityError.
3.11. Page 20, section: 7: How to handle half open connections not clear
It can sometimes happen that WebSockets connections are not opened or closed correctly. When this happens,
a WebSocket ping should detect this and cause a WebSocket to be closed. By sending WebSockets pings at a
regular interval, it should never happen that messages are dropped because of a half open connection.
10
Additional text Recommended to configure: WebSocketPingInterval smaller then: TransactionMessageAttempts *
TransactionMessageRetryInterval.
3.12. Page 20, section: 7: Missing configurationKey: AuthorizationKey
On page 17, a ConfigKey is named, but it is not listed in the list on page 20:
New text:
KEY VALUE
AuthorizationKey String
WriteOnly
Hexadecimal representation of the password that the Charging Station uses to authenticate itself if HTTP Basic
authentication is used. Maximum string length is 40 characters.
This configuration key is write-only, so that it cannot be accidentally stored in plaintext by the Central System
when it reads out all configuration keys.
4. Typos
Typos, fixes to incorrect links/reference, improve terms used etc. that have no impact on the description of the
way the protocol works.
None known
5. Known issues that will not be fixed
5.1. Page 14, par 4.2.3: CallError: Typo in enum
Typo in enum: OccurenceConstraintViolation
Old text OccurenceConstraintViolation
New text OccurrenceConstraintViolation
Do not fix, this is a message level change, might break implementations
Note: In the next version of OCPP we will add the correct spelling and make the incorrect (typo) value
deprecated.
5.2. Page 14, par 4.2.3. CallError: incorrect name in enum: FormationViolation
Incorrect name in enum: FormationViolation
11
Old text FormationViolation
New text FormatViolation
Do not fix, this is a message level change, might break implementations
Note: In the next version of OCPP we will add the correct spelling and make the incorrect (typo) value
deprecated.
