# WallboxTester - Functional Specification Document (FSD)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the functional requirements and test procedures for the WallboxTester OCPP 1.6-J test server implementation. The system provides comprehensive testing capabilities for electric vehicle charge points using the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) version 1.6-J.

### 1.2 System Architecture
The WallboxTester is a Python-based OCPP server that provides:
- WebSocket-based OCPP 1.6-J server implementation
- Web UI for test management and monitoring
- EV simulator integration for automated testing
- Real-time logging and status monitoring
- Comprehensive test suite execution

### 1.3 Key Components
- **OCPP Server**: WebSocket server handling charge point connections
- **Test Engine**: Automated test execution and validation
- **EV Simulator**: External EV state simulation for testing
- **Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring and control
- **Transaction Management**: Complete transaction lifecycle handling

## Test Categories and Test Cases

### **A. Core Communication & Status**

#### A.1: Initial Registration
Tests that the charge point has registered itself with the server by triggering a BootNotification.

#### A.2: Get Configuration
Retrieves and analyzes all OCPP configuration keys from the charge point, categorizing them as Core, Optional, or Vendor-specific.

#### A.3: Change Configuration
Tests the ability to modify charge point configuration by changing the HeartbeatInterval to 30 seconds.

#### A.4: Check Initial State
Verifies charge point status detection and EV state transitions (A→B→C→A) with transaction handling.

#### A.5: Trigger All Messages
Tests TriggerMessage functionality for StatusNotification, MeterValues, BootNotification, and other OCPP messages.

#### A.6: Meter Values
Triggers StatusNotification and MeterValues messages to test data acquisition capabilities.

### **B. Authorization & Transaction Management**

#### B.1: Reset Transaction Management
Resets the wallbox to a clean state by clearing all active transactions and setting connector availability to Operative.

#### B.2: Autonomous Start
Tests autonomous transaction initiation without manual authorization. Configures the wallbox for automatic start when an EV connects.

#### B.3: RFID Tap-to-Charge
Tests standard RFID card authorization flow with online authorization. Uses interactive modal with test mode for accepting any RFID card.

#### B.4: Anonymous Remote Start
Tests remote transaction start without RFID card requirement. Initiates charging session remotely without user identification.

#### B.5: Plug-and-Charge
Tests plug-and-charge functionality where charging starts automatically when EV is connected, without RFID or remote start.

#### B.6: Clear RFID Cache
Clears the local authorization list (RFID memory) using OCPP `ClearCache` command. May return "Rejected" if wallbox doesn't support local lists.

#### B.7: Send RFID List
Sends local authorization list with RFID cards (TEST_CARD_001, TEST_CARD_002, TEST_CARD_003) using `SendLocalList`. Returns "NotSupported" if feature unavailable.

#### B.8: Get RFID List Version
Retrieves version of local authorization list using `GetLocalListVersion`. Returns -1 if wallbox doesn't support local authorization lists.

### **X. System Control**

#### X.1: Reboot Wallbox
Performs emergency wallbox reboot using OCPP Reset Hard command. Forces termination of all active transactions and reboots the charge point.

### **C. Smart Charging Profile**

#### C.1: SetChargingProfile (TxProfile)
Sets transaction-specific charging profiles with configurable power/current limits, units (W/A), duration, and profile parameters. Automatically starts a transaction if none is active.

#### C.2: TxDefaultProfile
Sets default charging profiles that apply to future transactions at both charge point and connector levels. Does not require an active transaction.

#### C.3: GetCompositeSchedule
Retrieves and displays the current composite charging schedule from the charge point to verify active profile application. Shows charging rate unit, periods, limits, and phases.

#### C.4: ClearChargingProfile
Removes specific charging profiles from the charge point (specifically TxDefaultProfile types).

#### C.5: Cleanup
Comprehensive cleanup test that stops any active transactions, clears all charging profiles, and resets EV simulator state to 'A' (unplugged). Returns PARTIAL status if any step fails.

### **D. Advanced Charging Control**

#### D.1: Set Live Charging Power
Sets charging profiles for active transactions to control power dynamically during charging.

#### D.2: Set Default Charging Profile
Establishes default charging profiles for future transactions.

#### D.3: Smart Charging Capability Test
Comprehensive test that sets a temporary profile and immediately requests the composite schedule to verify smart charging functionality.

#### D.4: Clear Default Charging Profile
Removes default charging profiles from the charge point.

#### D.5: Set Profile 5000W
Sets a specific 5000W charging profile for testing high-power scenarios.

#### D.6: Set High Charging Profile
Sets maximum power charging profiles for testing wallbox limits.

### **E. Extended Transaction Tests**

#### E.1: Real-World Transaction Test
Comprehensive real-world transaction simulation with multiple charging states and profile changes.

#### E.2-E.8: Extended Charging Profile Tests
Various charging profile tests with different amperage settings (6A, 10A, 16A) and transaction management.

#### E.10: Get Composite Schedule
Extended composite schedule testing for complex charging scenarios.

#### E.11: Clear All Profiles
Comprehensive clearing of all charging profiles from the charge point.

## Automated Reactions 🤖

These messages can be handled automatically by a test script. The central system's reaction is predictable and does not require human input.

- **BootNotification:** Can be handled automatically by the test system. Upon receiving this message, the central system should send a `BootNotification.conf` response with the correct configuration.
- **StartTransaction:** Can be handled automatically. The central system should validate the message and send a `StartTransaction.conf` with a unique `transactionId`.
- **Heartbeat:** This message automatically updates the central system's record of the wallbox's status and last seen time. The system's response is an automated `Heartbeat.conf`.
- **StatusNotification:** Automatically updates the wallbox's status within the central system. The central system updates its internal state to reflect the status change (e.g., `Charging`, `Faulted`).
- **MeterValues:** This message automatically updates the meter values in the central system's database for the ongoing transaction.
- **StopTransaction:** Can be handled automatically. The central system finalizes the transaction record and sends a `StopTransaction.conf` in response.
- **Authorize:** Automatically handled using predefined valid ID tags (`test_id_1`, `test_id_2`). Returns `Accepted` for valid tags, `Invalid` for others.
